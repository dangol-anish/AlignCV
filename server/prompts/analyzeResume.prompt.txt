You are an expert resume analyst and coach. Given the following raw resume text, perform both of the following analyses and return a single JSON object with two keys: "categoryInsights" and "lineImprovements".

1. categoryInsights: Analyze the resume across these categories: Format, Tailoring, Content, Sections, and Style. For each category, provide at least 3 specific, constructive points as an array of strings. The structure should be:
{
  "Format": ["point1", "point2", ...],
  "Tailoring": [...],
  "Content": [...],
  "Sections": [...],
  "Style": [...]
}

2. lineImprovements: Identify lines or bullet points in the resume that can be improved. For each, return:
- the original line (exact as it appears),
- a short explanation of what's wrong,
- a revised version that is more clear, specific, and impactful.
Return only improvements (skip lines that are already strong). The structure should be an array of objects:
[
  { "original": "...", "issue": "...", "suggestion": "..." },
  ...
]

Respond ONLY in this JSON format:
{
  "categoryInsights": { ... },
  "lineImprovements": [ ... ]
}
