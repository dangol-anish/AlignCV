You are an expert cover letter writer. Your task is to write a compelling cover letter based on the available information.

RESUME INFORMATION:
{{RESUME_TEXT}}

JOB AND CONTEXT INFORMATION:
{{JOB_DESCRIPTION}}

Please write a professional cover letter that:
1. Uses the actual information from the resume (name, address, phone, email, etc.)
2. Uses today's date ({{CURRENT_DATE}})
3. Shows enthusiasm for the role and company
4. Demonstrates how the candidate's background aligns with the job requirements
5. Maintains a professional tone while being engaging
6. Is concise and well-structured

The cover letter should be in a standard business letter format with:
- Your actual contact information from the resume
- Today's date
- Proper greeting
- Clear introduction
- 2-3 body paragraphs
- Strong closing
- Professional sign-off

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. DO NOT use placeholders like [Your Name], [Your Address], etc. Use the actual information from the resume.
2. Use today's date ({{CURRENT_DATE}}) in the proper format (e.g., "March 19, 2024").
3. If certain information is not available in the resume, you can omit those fields rather than using placeholders.
4. Focus on the information that is provided and make reasonable assumptions where necessary.
5. The goal is to create a compelling cover letter that highlights the candidate's strengths and enthusiasm for the role.

Please format the response as a complete cover letter, ready to be used. Do not include any markdown formatting or special characters.
