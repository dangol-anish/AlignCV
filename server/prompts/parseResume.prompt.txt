  You're an intelligent resume parser. Analyze the following resume and extract all high-level sections as a structured JSON.

  Guidelines:
    - Each key should be the section title (e.g., "Summary", "Experience", "Skills", "Certifications", etc.).
    - Each value should contain the relevant content. If it's structured (like jobs, skills), return arrays or objects.
    - Be flexible: some resumes may include unique sections like "Awards", "Publications", or "Languages".
    - Only return the JSON. Do not include any commentary or code blocks.

    Resume:
    """${cleanedText}"""
